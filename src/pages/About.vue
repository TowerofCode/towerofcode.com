    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm just a regular individual with a desire to learn and share what I've
      learned. This website is meant to be a resource and in the end, I hope you
      at least gain something out of this. My secret goal is that you become
      extremely awesome, even though I already know you are awesome.
